osrframework.thirdparties.pipl_com.lib.containers) with their source (available in osrframework.thirdparties.pipl_com.lib.source)
and their fields (available in osrframework.thirdparties.pipl_com.lib.fields).
Importing can be done either with:
from osrframework.thirdparties.pipl_com.lib.containers import Record, Person
from osrframework.thirdparties.pipl_com.lib.fields import Name, Address
from osrframework.thirdparties.pipl_com.lib.source import Source
or simply with:
from osrframework.thirdparties.pipl_com.lib import Record, Person, Name, Address, Source
